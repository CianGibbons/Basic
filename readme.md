# Wander Yonder

Wander Yonder is a project that we have been working on since late 2019

Wander Yonder in simple terms is a web application which allows users to create lists of attractions from cities across the world. Each list is created personally by liking or disliking our recommendations in a slider based page. Users can see more information on certain attractions while also leaving comments 

The main pages of the site are as follows:
-The main page will provide the user with a brief introduction to the site, show them what cities are available in the service and guide them towards the login / sign up page to further access the site.
-The signup and login pages are self explanatory. 
-The main idea around Wander Yonder and its unique selling point is its slider page. This is what the entire site is almost based around. When a user picks a city they would like to create a list for, they are taken here. The page presents the user with cards featuring the name, photo and a brief description of each attraction. If they want more info, they click the information icon which brings them to an information page. This page provides them with a more detailed look at the attraction. This includes a longer description and its location on a map. 
-Once initialized, they are then available to view them in their lists page. On this page they can view the attraction info pages once again, copy the attractions location (i.e for use in a navigation service) and view the distance from their position to the attraction.
-The profile page lets users view and edit their details, as well as view a selection of statistics about their site use 
-Other pages include our about page, contact form, admin only pages such as add and edit attractions as well as  our privacy policy
